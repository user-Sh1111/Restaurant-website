# Granada Restaurant Website

Welcome to the Granada Restaurant Website project! This is a web-based application designed to showcase the restaurant's menu, about page, contact information, banquet services, and latest news/events. The website also includes user authentication features with login/register functionality.

## Project Overview
This project is a static website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a responsive design with Bootstrap for layout management, jQuery for interactive elements, and local storage for user authentication. The website provides an online presence for the Granada Restaurant, allowing visitors to explore the menu, book banquet services, view news, and get in touch.

## File Structure
The project is organized in the following directory structure under `C:\Users\balga\Downloads\вебка\2025\restaurant_website\restaurant_website\restaurant_website\`:

### HTML Files
- `index.html`: Homepage with welcome message and news section.
- `about.html`: About page with restaurant details.
- `contact.html`: Contact information and map link.
- `banquet.html`: Banquet service request form with validation.
- `menus.html`: Restaurant menu page with various categories.

### CSS Files
- `css/styles.css`: Main stylesheet containing global styles, responsive design, and component-specific styling (e.g., modal, menu, news).

### JavaScript Files
- `js/script.js`: Custom JavaScript for dynamic content, including news fetching, form validation, and user authentication.
- `js/news.json`: JSON file containing news data for the homepage.

### Image Files
- `images/news_1.png`: Image for the first news/event.
- `images/new_event.jpeg`: Alternative event image (not currently used).

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone or Download the Project**:
   - Download the project folder from `C:\Users\balga\Downloads\вебка\2025\restaurant_website\restaurant_website\restaurant_website\` or clone it if using version control.
   
2. **Open in a Code Editor**:
   - Use Visual Studio Code or any other code editor. Open the project folder by selecting "Open Folder" from the Explorer panel.

3. **Run the Website**:
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the homepage.
   - Alternatively, use a local server (e.g., Live Server extension in VS Code) for full functionality, as the `fetch` API for `news.json` requires a server environment.

4. **Dependencies**:
   - The project uses Bootstrap (via CDN) for styling and layout.
   - Ensure an internet connection for Bootstrap to load properly.
   - No additional installations are required.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Interactive Elements**: Hamburger menu, modal for login/register, button click sounds, and dynamic news section.
- **User Authentication**: Login and register functionality using local storage.
- **Banquet Booking**: Form with validation for requesting banquet services.
- **News Section**: Fetches and displays news from `news.json` with a fallback to mock data.
- **Menu Display**: Organized menu categories with pricing.

## Usage
- Navigate through the website using the header menu (Menus, About, Contact, Banquet Service).
- Log in or register using the account button to access personalized features.
- Explore the menu, book a banquet, or contact the restaurant via the respective pages.
